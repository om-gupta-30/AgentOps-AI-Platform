"""
History Router

This router handles endpoints for retrieving task history from memory storage.

Endpoints:
- GET /history - List all stored memory records (successful tasks)

Responsibilities:
1. Load memory records from memory store
2. Return lightweight summaries (without full outputs)
3. Support future pagination and filtering

NOT responsible for:
- Executing tasks (that's run.py)
- Storing memories (that's done automatically by evaluator_node)
- Real-time updates (that's WebSocket streaming)

# Removed: GET /history/{memory_id} endpoint (not needed for v1)
# Removed: GET /history/stats endpoint (can be added later if needed)
#
# Future Enhancements:
# 1. Add GET /history/{memory_id} for full details (with final_output)
# 2. Add pagination to GET /history (page, page_size params)
# 3. Add filtering (by score, date range, search term)
# 4. Add sorting (by created_at, score, relevance)
# 5. Add DELETE /history/{memory_id} for cleanup


# =============================================================================
# Future Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)
# =============================================================================
#
# 1. PAGINATION:
#    - Add page and page_size query parameters
#    - Return has_next flag for client-side pagination
#    - Default: 20 results per page, max 100
#
# 2. FILTERING:
#    - Filter by score (min_score, max_score)
#    - Filter by date range (created_after, created_before)
#    - Search user_goal (case-insensitive substring match)
#
# 3. SORTING:
#    - Sort by created_at (asc/desc)
#    - Sort by score (asc/desc)
#    - Sort by user_goal (alphabetical)
#
# 4. DETAIL ENDPOINT:
#    - GET /history/{memory_id}
#    - Return full memory record (with final_output)
#    - Useful for inspecting specific tasks
#
# 5. DELETE ENDPOINT:
#    - DELETE /history/{memory_id}
#    - Remove specific memory from storage
#    - Require authentication/authorization
#
# 6. STATS ENDPOINT:
#    - GET /history/stats
#    - Aggregate metrics (total, avg score, etc.)
#    - Useful for dashboard/analytics
#
# 7. EXPORT ENDPOINT:
#    - GET /history/export?format=json|csv
#    - Export all memories for backup/analysis
#    - Rate limited
