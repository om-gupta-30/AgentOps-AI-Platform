Vector Store for Memory Retrieval

This module provides semantic search capabilities for memory retrieval using
vector embeddings and a local Chroma database.

=============================================================================
WHAT ARE EMBEDDINGS?
=============================================================================

Embeddings are numerical representations (vectors) of text that capture semantic meaning.

Example:
    Text: "Explain vector databases"
    Embedding: [0.23, -0.15, 0.87, ..., 0.34]  (1536 numbers)

Key Properties:
1. Similar text → Similar vectors (close together in vector space)
2. Captures meaning, not just keywords
3. Language models like Gemini produce embeddings as a "side effect" of understanding text

Think of embeddings as coordinates in a high-dimensional space where semantically
similar concepts are located near each other.

=============================================================================
WHY VECTORS ARE BETTER THAN KEYWORD MATCHING
=============================================================================

Keyword Matching (Current Implementation):
    Query: "Explain vector databases"
    Stored: "Describe embedding storage systems"
    Result: ❌ NO MATCH (no shared keywords)

Vector/Semantic Search (This Implementation):
    Query: "Explain vector databases"
    Stored: "Describe embedding storage systems"  
    Result: ✅ MATCH (semantically similar, ~85% similarity)

Advantages of Vector Search:
1. SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING:
   - Matches by meaning, not just exact words
   - "car" matches "automobile", "vehicle", "sedan"
   
2. HANDLES SYNONYMS:
   - "fast" → "quick", "rapid", "speedy"
   - No need for manual synonym lists
   
3. MULTILINGUAL POTENTIAL:
   - Can match across languages (with multilingual models)
   - "Hello" matches "Bonjour", "Hola"
   
4. TYPO TOLERANCE:
   - Embeddings are robust to minor spelling errors
   - "databse" still close to "database"

5. CONTEXT AWARENESS:
   - "apple" (fruit) vs "apple" (company) have different embeddings
   - Understands context from surrounding words

Trade-offs:
- Slower: Requires computing embeddings (API call or local model)
- Complex: Needs vector database infrastructure
- Black Box: Harder to debug than keyword matching
- Cost: Embedding APIs have per-token costs

=============================================================================
WHY THIS IS ONLY USED FOR MEMORY RETRIEVAL
=============================================================================

This vector store is EXCLUSIVELY for finding relevant past task completions
during the Supervisor's planning phase. It is NOT used for:

❌ General knowledge retrieval (use RAG/document search instead)
❌ User query understanding (LLM handles that)
❌ Tool selection (agent logic handles that)
❌ Caching LLM outputs (different system entirely)

Why Memory-Only?
1. FOCUSED SCOPE:
   - Memory entries have consistent structure (user_goal, summary, output)
   - Purpose-built for "find similar past tasks"
   - Different from generic document search

2. HIGH QUALITY DATA:
   - Only stores validated outputs (score >= 8)
   - Clean, well-structured data ideal for embeddings
   - No noise from failed attempts or drafts

3. SMALL DATASET:
   - Max 100-1000 memory entries (manageable size)
   - Vector DB overhead justified by better retrieval
   - Would be overkill for 10-20 entries

4. CRITICAL USE CASE:
   - Supervisor planning benefits most from semantic matching
   - Finding similar past tasks prevents redundant research
   - Slight latency (embedding computation) is acceptable here

5. AVOIDS COMPLEXITY:
   - Keeps vector DB isolated to one use case
   - Easier to debug, test, and maintain
   - Clear boundaries prevent scope creep

        HOW EMBEDDING COMPARISON WORKS:
        ===============================
        Query side: We embed just the user_goal (the question being asked)
        Storage side: We embedded user_goal + summary (question + solution)

        - Match: Yes! Query about "vector databases" matches stored summary mentioning "embeddings"
        
        Benefits:
        1. Query matches similar QUESTIONS (same goal, different wording)
        2. Query matches similar SOLUTIONS (different goal, but same concepts in summary)
        3. Maximizes recall (finds more relevant memories)
        
        Example:
        - Query: "How to set up semantic search?"

          * Goal: "Explain vector databases" (different question, but summary has "semantic search")
          * Goal: "Configure Chroma for retrieval" (similar task)
        
        Steps:
        1. Embed the query (user_goal → vector)
        2. Search Chroma for nearest neighbors (similar vectors)
        3. Filter by similarity threshold
        4. Convert results back to MemoryRecord objects

                           - 0.9-1.0: Nearly identical (exact rephrasing)

# =============================================================================
# Usage Example
# =============================================================================
#
# from memory.memory_store import MemoryRecord, save_memory
# from memory.vector_store import VectorMemoryStore
# from datetime import datetime, timezone
#
# # EXAMPLE 1: Saving a new memory (automatic vector store integration)
# # ====================================================================
# new_memory = MemoryRecord(
#     id="123",
#     user_goal="Explain vector databases for semantic search",
#     summary="Vector databases store embeddings and support similarity search...",
#     final_output="Full explanation here...",
#     score=9,
#     created_at=datetime.now(timezone.utc),
# )
#
# # Save to JSON - vector store update happens automatically!
# if save_memory(new_memory):
#     print("✅ Memory saved to JSON and vector store")
# # Behind the scenes:
# # 1. JSON write succeeds
# # 2. Embedding generated from: user_goal + summary
# # 3. Vector stored with memory.id as document ID
# # 4. If vector storage fails, JSON still has it (non-blocking)
#
#
# # EXAMPLE 2: Searching for similar memories
# # ==========================================
# store = VectorMemoryStore()
#
# # Search by user goal - matches both similar goals AND similar summaries
# results = store.find_similar(
#     user_goal="How to use embeddings?",  # Query
#     top_k=3,
#     min_similarity=0.6,
# )
#
# print(f"Found {len(results)} similar memories:")
# for memory, similarity in results:
#     print(f"\n[Similarity: {similarity:.2%}]")
#     print(f"Goal: {memory.user_goal}")
#     print(f"Summary: {memory.summary[:100]}...")
#     print(f"Score: {memory.score}/10")
#
# # Example output:
# # [92%] Goal: Explain vector databases for semantic search
# #       Summary: Vector databases store embeddings and support similarity search...
# #       (High match: query "embeddings" matches summary "embeddings")
#
#
# # EXAMPLE 3: Syncing vector store with existing JSON memories
# # =============================================================
# # Run this on startup or if vector store gets out of sync
# store = VectorMemoryStore()
# added_count = store.sync_from_json()
# print(f"✅ Synced {added_count} memories to vector store")
#
# =============================================================================


# =============================================================================
# Performance Notes
# =============================================================================
#
# SPEED:
# - Embedding generation: ~50-200ms per query (API call to Google)
# - Vector search (local): <10ms for 100-1000 entries
# - Total latency: ~100-250ms (acceptable for planning phase)
#
# ACCURACY:
# - Vector search typically outperforms keyword matching by 20-40%
# - Recall (finding relevant results) is much higher
# - Precision (avoiding false positives) is similar
#
# SCALING:
# - This setup works well for 100-10,000 memory entries
# - Beyond 10k entries, consider:
#   - Cloud vector DB (Pinecone, Weaviate)
#   - Distributed search (Elasticsearch with vector plugin)
#   - Hierarchical indexing (coarse + fine search)
#
# COST:
# - Chroma: Free (local, open source)
# - Google embeddings: Free tier (15k queries/min)
# - After free tier: ~$0.0001 per query (very cheap)
#
