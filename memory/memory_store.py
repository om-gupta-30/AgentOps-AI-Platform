Memory storage models and utilities.

This module defines the data structures for storing successful task completions
in memory. Memory is used exclusively by the Supervisor agent during planning
to learn from past successes and avoid redundant research.

IMPORTANT DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Only high-quality outputs (score >= 8, pass = True) are stored
- Memory entries are sanitized (PII removed, size limited)
- Memory is advisory, not prescriptive
- Failed memory operations never block user responses

# =============================================================================
# Memory Configuration Constants
# =============================================================================
#
# These constants define the boundaries of the memory system to prevent
# unbounded growth, stale data accumulation, and storage of low-quality outputs.
#
# Centralizing these values here makes it easy to:
# 1. Adjust limits based on deployment environment (dev vs prod)
# 2. Document the rationale for each limit
# 3. Ensure consistent behavior across all memory operations
# 4. Enable easy testing with different configurations
# =============================================================================

MAX_MEMORIES: int = 100
# Maximum number of memory entries to retain at any time.
#
# Why this limit exists:
# 1. RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE:
#    - Simple keyword matching is O(n) where n = number of memories
#    - With 100 entries, retrieval is sub-millisecond
#    - Beyond 1000 entries, consider switching to a vector database
#
# 2. STORAGE FOOTPRINT:
#    - Each entry ≈ 3.5KB (goal + summary + output + metadata)
#    - 100 entries ≈ 350KB total (negligible)
#    - JSON file remains human-readable for debugging
#
# 3. QUALITY OVER QUANTITY:
#    - Storing top 100 successful tasks is usually sufficient for pattern recognition
#    - More entries can lead to noise (old, irrelevant, or outdated tasks)
#
# 4. EVICTION STRATEGY:
#    - When limit reached, evict oldest entries (FIFO)
#    - Alternative: evict least-retrieved entries (LRU)
#    - Alternative: evict lowest-scored entries
#
# Tuning guidance:
# - Small deployments (single user): 50-100 entries
# - Medium deployments (team): 500-1000 entries
# - Large deployments (enterprise): Use vector DB, no hard limit

MIN_SCORE_TO_KEEP: int = 7
# Minimum evaluation score to retain in memory.
#
# Why this limit exists:
# 1. QUALITY GATE DURING STORAGE:
#    - At write time, only score >= 8 are stored (high quality)
#    - This constant defines the RETENTION threshold (can be lower)
#
# 2. GRADUAL QUALITY DEGRADATION:
#    - Score 8-10: Stored immediately, kept for full retention period
#    - Score 7: Not stored initially, but if manually added or imported, kept for shorter period
#    - Score < 7: Never stored, or evicted immediately during cleanup
#
# 3. CLEANUP POLICY:
#    - Periodic cleanup (daily/weekly) can lower the threshold over time
#    - Example: After 30 days, entries with score < 8 can be demoted to score 7 retention
#    - After 60 days, entries with score < 9 can be evicted
#
# 4. EMERGENCY SPACE RECLAMATION:
#    - If storage limit reached, evict entries with score < MIN_SCORE_TO_KEEP first
#    - This ensures only the highest-quality memories survive under pressure
#
# Tuning guidance:
# - Strict quality: MIN_SCORE_TO_KEEP = 8 (same as write threshold)
# - Moderate quality: MIN_SCORE_TO_KEEP = 7 (keep slightly lower-quality memories)
# - Lenient quality: MIN_SCORE_TO_KEEP = 6 (maximize memory coverage, risk pollution)

MAX_MEMORY_AGE_DAYS: int = 90
# Maximum age (in days) before a memory entry is considered stale and evicted.
#
# Why this limit exists:
# 1. PREVENTS STALE KNOWLEDGE:
#    - Technology/best practices change (e.g., "Use Python 2.7" becomes outdated)
#    - Agent system evolves (new capabilities, different prompt strategies)
#    - 90 days balances recency with sufficient history
#
# 2. COMPLIANCE AND PRIVACY:
#    - Even with PII redaction, old data carries privacy risk
#    - GDPR/CCPA often require data minimization (keep only what's needed)
#    - Automatic expiration reduces compliance burden
#
# 3. PREVENTS MEMORY DRIFT:
#    - Old memories can anchor the system to outdated patterns
#    - Example: If the system learns a suboptimal approach, keeping it for
#      months prevents the system from adapting to better methods
#
# 4. STORAGE HYGIENE:
#    - Periodic cleanup prevents indefinite accumulation
#    - Keeps memory focused on recent, relevant patterns
#
# 5. TIERED RETENTION (Future Enhancement):
#    - Score 8: Retain for 30 days
#    - Score 9: Retain for 60 days
#    - Score 10: Retain for 90 days (exceptional quality)
#
# Tuning guidance:
# - Fast-moving domain (AI/ML research): 30-60 days
# - Stable domain (accounting, legal): 180-365 days
# - Compliance-sensitive: 30 days (minimize retention)
# - High-value memories: Store separately with manual review

    A single memory entry representing a successfully completed task.

    This schema is designed to avoid memory pollution by:

    2. Storing summaries instead of full outputs to prevent prompt bloat
    3. Including timestamps for automatic expiration of stale entries

    # - Prevents prompt bloat: 1000 chars max vs potentially 10KB+ full outputs
    # - Improves retrieval relevance: summaries are more semantically focused

    # Pollution prevention:
    # - max_length=2000 enforces aggressive truncation (vs 10KB+ raw outputs)
    # - Still long enough to capture key structure and style
    # - Prevents memory from becoming a full output cache
    #
    # IMPORTANT: This field is optional in the original design doc (summary only).
    # Including it here for completeness, but it could be made Optional[str] if

    # Pollution prevention:

    #    - Only the top ~20% of successful outputs are stored
    #    - Failed attempts never enter memory
    #    - Borderline outputs (score 6-7) are excluded
    #
    # 2. SIZE LIMITS:
    #    - user_goal: max 500 chars (prevents overly specific or vague goals)
    #    - summary: max 1000 chars (forces distillation of key insights)
    #    - final_output: max 2000 chars (prevents memory bloat)
    #    - Total entry size: ~3.5KB max (enables fast retrieval)
    #
    # 3. REQUIRED FIELDS:
    #    - No optional fields means every entry is complete
    #    - Incomplete entries are rejected at validation time
    #    - Prevents partial/corrupted entries from polluting memory
    #
    # 4. TIMESTAMP-BASED EXPIRATION:
    #    - created_at enables automatic cleanup of stale entries
    #    - Memory doesn't accumulate indefinitely
    #    - Outdated knowledge is periodically purged
    #
    # 5. UNIQUE IDs:
    #    - Prevents duplicate entries for the same task
    #    - Enables explicit deletion of problematic entries
    #
    # 6. VALIDATION AT WRITE TIME:
    #    - Pydantic enforces constraints before storage

# Future Enhancements (Not Implemented Yet)
# =============================================================================
#
# 1. METADATA FIELDS:
#    Consider adding optional metadata for better retrieval:
#    - tags: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list)  # ["technical", "explanation"]
#    - required_research: bool                         # Was research needed?
#    - plan_steps: list[str]                           # What plan worked?
#    - iteration_count: int                            # How many retries?
#
# 2. EMBEDDING FIELD:
#    Store the embedding of user_goal directly for faster retrieval:
#    - embedding: Optional[list[float]] = None         # 1536-dim vector (OpenAI)
#
# 3. USAGE TRACKING:
#    Track how often each entry is retrieved:
#    - retrieval_count: int = 0                        # How many times retrieved?
#    - last_retrieved_at: Optional[datetime] = None    # When was it last used?
#    This enables eviction of low-utility entries (never retrieved in 30 days)
#
# 4. VERSION TAGGING:
#    Track which system version created this entry:
#    - system_version: str = "v0.1"                    # Enables bulk deletion on upgrades
#
# 5. SANITIZATION METADATA:
#    Track what was sanitized for audit purposes:
#    - pii_redacted: bool = False                      # Was PII found and removed?
#    - redactions: list[str] = []                      # ["EMAIL", "PHONE_NUMBER"]


# =============================================================================
# Storage Backend: Simple JSON File
# =============================================================================
#
# This implementation uses a local JSON file for simplicity and portability.
# For production, consider:
# - Vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant) for semantic search
# - SQLite with FTS5 for full-text search
# - PostgreSQL with pgvector for hybrid search
# - Redis for high-throughput caching
#
# The JSON file approach is sufficient for:
# - Development and testing
# - Small deployments (< 1000 entries)
# - Single-instance systems (no concurrent writes)

import json
import os
from pathlib import Path


# Define the memory file path relative to this module
# This ensures the file is always created in the /memory directory
MEMORY_FILE = Path(__file__).parent / "memory.json"


def save_memory(record: MemoryRecord) -> bool:
    """
    Save a single memory record to the local JSON file with automatic pruning.

    This function is designed to NEVER crash the application. If any error occurs
    (disk full, permission denied, etc.), it logs the error and returns False.

    Automatic Maintenance (on every write):
    - Enforces MIN_SCORE_TO_KEEP (rejects low-quality records)
    - Prunes entries older than MAX_MEMORY_AGE_DAYS
    - Enforces MAX_MEMORIES limit (keeps most recent)

    Why prune on write (not separate cleanup job)?
    1. SIMPLICITY: No need for cron jobs or background workers
    2. INCREMENTAL: Cleanup cost is amortized across writes (each write cleans a little)
    3. GUARANTEED: Memory limits are always enforced, even if cleanup job fails
    4. TESTABLE: Easier to test (write → verify limits) vs async cleanup
    5. LOW OVERHEAD: Pruning 100 entries takes <1ms, negligible compared to LLM calls

    Args:
        record: A validated MemoryRecord instance (Pydantic ensures it's valid)

    Returns:
        True if save succeeded, False otherwise

    Safety Guarantees:
    - File is created if missing
    - Existing entries are preserved (append-only behavior)
    - Pruning errors do not crash the system (logged and skipped)
    - Disk errors do not crash the system
    - Invalid records are rejected at validation time (Pydantic)

    Performance:
    - O(n) where n = number of existing entries (reads all, prunes, writes all)
    - Not suitable for high-frequency writes (>100/sec)
    - For high throughput, use a proper database with indexed cleanup

        # Timeline:
        # t=0: User task completes
        # t=1: Evaluator scores it (e.g., score=9, pass=True)
        # t=2: save_memory() writes to JSON ← Critical path ends here

    - Consider creating a backup before overwriting in production

    Performance:

# =============================================================================


def find_relevant_memories(

    max_results: int = 3,
) -> list[MemoryRecord]:
    """
    Find the most relevant memory entries for a given user goal using semantic search.

    This implementation uses vector embeddings and similarity search to find
    semantically related memories, even when exact keywords don't match.

    VECTOR-BASED RETRIEVAL (Current Implementation):
    =================================================
    
    How it works:
    1. Embed the incoming user_goal (query → vector)
    2. Search vector DB for most similar stored memories
    3. Return top-k matches ranked by semantic similarity
    
    Advantages over keyword matching:
    - Matches by MEANING, not just exact words
    - Handles synonyms: "car" matches "automobile", "vehicle"
    - Context-aware: "apple" (fruit) vs "apple" (company)
    - Typo-tolerant: embeddings robust to spelling errors
    
    Example:
        Query: "How to use embeddings for search?"
        Matches:
        ✓ Goal: "Explain vector databases" (summary mentions "embeddings")
        ✓ Goal: "Set up semantic search" (conceptually related)
        ✗ Goal: "Configure FastAPI routes" (unrelated)
    
    GRACEFUL FALLBACK:
    ==================
    
    If vector DB is unavailable (not installed, API error, empty):
    - Returns empty list (does NOT crash)
    - Logs warning for debugging
    - System continues functioning (vector search is optional)
    
    Why empty list (not exception):
    - Memory retrieval is advisory, not critical
    - Supervisor can plan without memories (just less optimized)
    - Better to degrade gracefully than fail hard
    - User experience is unaffected
    
    Args:
        user_goal: The current user request to match against stored memories
        max_results: Maximum number of memories to return (default: 3)

    Returns:
        List of MemoryRecord instances, sorted by relevance (best match first)
        Returns empty list if:
        - No memories stored yet
        - user_goal is empty/invalid
        - Vector DB unavailable or empty
        - No matches above similarity threshold

    Performance:
    - Embedding generation: ~50-200ms (API call to Google)
    - Vector search: <10ms (local Chroma DB)
    - Total: ~100-250ms (acceptable for planning phase)
